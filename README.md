# Flipping Out

This is a program designed to show off the graphing and plotting capabilities
in Python. The program runs a simulation of coin flipping and returns several
drawings that depict different distributions.

The work is all done in a Jupyter Notebook file. Please see the Git repository
for access to the file. Jupyter is capable of running and outputting the graphs
and plots in line, which the terminal cannot do.

## Interaction

To access the program, you must have Jupyter installed on your system. The
file will then run in a web browser. Simply use Shift+Enter on each code block
to execute the commands.
